# Pretendo Installer (Wii U)

This is the official Pretendo installer for Wii U.
Note that there is also a sample xml and icon somewhere in the repo

## Usage

Just run this in the hbl

## Dependencies

To properly compile this project yourself you will need the latest libiosuhax from dimok789's github. (May already be included)
Two certificates need to be put in ./installer/data:
	- The original wii u common cert (named oldcert.der)
	- The cert from fiddler (named newcert.der)
Some other dependencies may be needed that I can't remember lol

## Credit

This installer is based off of the haxchi installer originally by FIX94, and tweaked by jam1garner.
